fix: Fix filter "전체" (All) option not working in search

- Fixed bug where selecting "전체" (All) filter in search mode
  would not return results from all regions
- Modified areaCode handling logic in app/page.tsx:
  - Search mode (with keyword): "전체" selection passes undefined
    to fetchTourSearch, allowing search across all regions
  - List mode (without keyword): "전체" selection defaults to "1"
    (Seoul) to maintain existing behavior
- Updated filter display logic to correctly show applied filters
  for both search and list modes
- Fixed contentTypeId handling to properly handle empty values

This ensures that when users search with "전체" filter selected,
they get results from all regions instead of being limited to
Seoul (default areaCode "1").
