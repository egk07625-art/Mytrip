fix: improve baseUrl resolution for internal API calls in Vercel deployment

- Use Next.js 15 headers() API to get request URL dynamically
- Improve baseUrl determination logic for Vercel environment
- Add detailed logging for debugging API requests
- Add comprehensive error handling and diagnostics

Changes:
- app/page.tsx: Use headers() to get host and protocol from request
- app/api/tour/route.ts: Add request URL and headers logging
- Add fallback logic for baseUrl: host header → NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL → VERCEL_URL → localhost
- Improve error messages with detailed diagnostics

This fixes 401 errors that occur when Server Component tries to call
internal API routes in Vercel deployment environment where baseUrl
was not properly resolved.
