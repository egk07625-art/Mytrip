fix: Improve Vercel build-time environment variable handling for Clerk

- Add explicit env variable injection in next.config.ts for build-time access
- Enhance environment variable debugging in app/layout.tsx with detailed logging
- Add comprehensive error messages with debug info for missing env vars
- Create troubleshooting guides for Vercel environment variable issues:
  - docs/vercel-clerk-env-fix.md
  - docs/vercel-env-build-time-fix.md
  - docs/vercel-env-not-injected-fix.md

This addresses the issue where NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY was not
available during build-time static generation, causing prerender errors
for the not-found page.
